## Using Alces flight to create a temporary HPC cluster for an MPI training course
We used the free version of Alces Flight along with customisation scripts and Amazon spot pricing to create a temporary cluster with up to 128 cores to support an MPI training course.

Total HPC costs for the 2 days was around $40 and the cluster performed perfectly.
